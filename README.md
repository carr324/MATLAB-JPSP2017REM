# MATLAB-jpsp2017-REM
MATLAB starter code for REM modeling used in Carr et al. (JPSP 2017)

Here's some MATLAB code that reflects the method we used in Carr et al. (JPSP 2017), where we adapt the Retrieving Effectively from Memory (REM; Shiffrin & Steyvers, 1997) model to estimate the effects of familiarity training on memory traces for individual vs. morphed faces.  Access the full paper here (the REM modelling is described in the "Computational Memory Modelling" section):  https://evanwalkercarr.weebly.com/uploads/3/2/3/1/32319711/carr_et_al.__2017__-_jpsp.pdf.
